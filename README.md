##  you use powerful motors that draw a lot of current, DO NOT USE L293D/L298N, it will fry your arduino due to power surge.

The code has been tested on a race track with complementary black and white lines and works perfectly well.
Depending on the type of turns present in the race track, modify the possible error conditions and flags.

## Feel free to ping or raise requests if you face any troubles or if you want to add something as well
## Dont forget to credit me if the code comes to your help. Cheers!!
